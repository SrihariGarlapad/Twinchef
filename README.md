Most often, we get into a situation when we want to cook something delicious, however, we are short on ingredients at our home. It also creates a lot of confusion about what to cook with the available ingredients. Further, we might not have accessibility to more ingredients from the nearby market due to various reasons like non-availability. In such a situation we keep on searching for recipes that match our ingredients online, but hardly get any results and that too takes a lot of time, and ultimately we return to our kitchen disappointed. There√Ωs a need for a system that could actually take ingredients as the input and give us the list of most matching recipes that could help us make delicious food at our homes. Our project aims to make a user aware of the various dishes which can be cooked from the available set of ingredients being input by a user. Scrapping Module - Scraping the dataset for ingredients, recipes, etc. Training Model - Fetching the data and display the output based on the input. Developing UI - Developing a user-friendly UI to present the recipes based on the user inputs
