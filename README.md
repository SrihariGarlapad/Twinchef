In today's fast-paced world, finding time to cook can be a challenge, especially when we're limited by the ingredients we have on hand. Often, we find ourselves in situations where we want to prepare something delicious but are restricted by what's available in our kitchen. The frustration of not being able to access additional ingredients from nearby markets due to reasons like non-availability or time constraints only adds to the dilemma. This often leads to endless searching online for recipes that match our ingredients, which is time-consuming and rarely fruitful, leaving us disappointed and without a solution.

Project Overview

Our project seeks to address this very challenge by developing a system that empowers users to make the most of their available ingredients. By simply inputting the ingredients they have, users will receive a list of recipes that can be created with those ingredients, allowing them to prepare delicious meals without the need for additional shopping trips.
